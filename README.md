# Melbourne Developer Meetup: How to Career

## If You're Employed

### Have a Plan
- Identify your long term objectives. Where do you see yourself in a year? In 5 years? In 20 years? When you're 80 and looking back at your life, what have you achieved that makes you satisfied?
- Set milestones and think about how you can reach them.
- Be willing to get out of your comfort zone.
- Do a retrospective on your career path every once in while. Ask yourself:
  - What should you start doing?
  - What should you stop doing?
  - What should you keep doing?

### Build Your Personal Brand
- Build your network; Offline as well as online:
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)
  - [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/)
  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  - etc.
- Position yourself within the right group of people. "We are who we hang out with."
- The IT industry in Australia is a small world. Treat everyone well; People you work with now, your acquaintances, recruiters, etc.
- Be mindful of what you post on social media.

## If You're in the Market

### Let Your Network Know

- Get in touch with recruiters but know that their goal is to fill in positions, not to find you a job.
- Stay confident and never give up.
- Good jobs sites:

  - etc.
- Expand your reach as much as you possibly can.

### Embrace Change
- Are you too busy to nudge your career path in the right direction?
- Stick to your values.
- Be opportunistic, turn bad events into opportunities.

### Apply, Interview, Rinse, Repeat
- Send as many as resumes as possible for jobs that matter to you; Even the ones that might seem out of reach. You'll never know!
- Study the companies you are applying for.
  - What is their vision?
  - What are their values and do they stick to them?
  - What's their culture like?
  - etc.
- Personalise each CV and Cover Letter you send to companies.
- Keep a copy of every single application you submit for future reference.
- Practice interviewing. Then practice more, and then even more.
- Dress for success, not only for interviews, but also your day-to-day job.
- When interviewing, be confident, be yourself, and do not BS.
- Find out who is going to interview you and what their professional background is.
- Always negotiate your salary. It'll turn into one of your most profitable sentences you'll ever say in your life.
- Be courageous enough to turn down an offer if you're not entirely satisfied with the type of work and the culture.
- For more interview and job seeking tips consult the internet but use your own judgement.

## If You're an Employer

### Do Care
- Help your employees with their career development.
- For many professionals, money is not the main factor in choosing a job.
- Give back and support the community.
